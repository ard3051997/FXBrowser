# A simple Android web browser

![LOGO](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16880885/43814276-1c7b3584-9afc-11e8-97c8-1fb71b683930.png)

Just playing around. It's just a simple encapsulation of WebView...how simple is it? It’s so simple that there is only one Activity in the entire project file, and the actual code is less than 400 lines~

The code inside is attached with detailed comments. Beginners can refer to it if they are interested.

No picture, no truth

Let’s take a look at some actual measurement pictures...

- The address bar supports intelligent identification of URLs and search terms (Okay, just add a regular expression~)
- Changed to a more stylish LOGO

#### 2017/5/24 v0.1.0
- I just started learning Android development and I improvised this to practice. The code is messy.
